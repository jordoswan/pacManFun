# pacManFun
## A fun first coding project with a lovable character from your childhood :)

Using the four different images, I was able to program pacman to move from right to left accross the screen, turn him around once he hit a specified boundry, and then move him back from left to right. I was also able to program him to go back and forth across the screen non stop.
